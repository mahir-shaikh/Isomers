<c f="Business Challenges" a="$C$10" r="10" c="3" w="tx_Introduction" v="Business Challenges" fmt="General">
</c>
<c f="MedAssist is one of the largest home health and hospice care providers in Maturia, a developed state with a mature economy similar to the United States. The company offers a wide array of services, including skilled nursing (RNs &amp; LPNs) and therapy (therapists &amp; assistants). Patients are covered by Medicare, PPS, or private payers, and customers include episodic and non-episodic payers, often referred through MDs, residential and assisted living, rehab, skilled nursing facilities, and word of mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company has a strong market position. Last year, the two care centers that you&apos;ll be managing for MedAssist drove approximately $12.8 million in revenue and maintained a net income from operations (NIFO) of $1.9 million. In order to uphold MedAssist&apos;s competitive position in this pod, you and your team members must overcome a range of challenges and drive profitable growth for your two care centers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Care Centers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two care centers you&apos;ll be managing for MedAssist are the Riverside Center and the Pleasantville Center; both care centers are located in the same pod. Although you manage roughly 100 employees between both care centers, within each simulated care center, you will have the opportunity to interact with 10 clinicians (a proportional representation of your clinicians).&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riverside&lt;/b&gt; is larger in size and located in one of Maturia&apos;s larger cities. Over the last few years, Riverside has faced slowed growth due to regional competitors and a large national competitor entering the market. High operational costs and low employee productivity are often cited as the two key areas for improvement, as they are the main contributors negatively impacting the care center&apos;s already low NIFO.
